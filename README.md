# Sisense Custom Widget: Material UI Table
 This project is an example of how to build a custom widget for Sisense which depend on external libraries, such as React and MaterialUI components.

 ## Instructions
 - Clone repository
 - run `npm install` to add dependencies
 - run 'npm run build' to compile the outputs
 - - Alternative shortcut - download the [zip from this repo](https://github.com/sisensers/materialUiTable/raw/master/zip/MaterialUiTable.zip)
 - copy the 'MaterialUITable' folder and its contents from the `build` folder to your Sisense plugins folder (usually /plugins in the file management UI).
 - once the plugins have re-compiled within Sisense, create a new widget after refreshing your browser, and select 'Material UI Table' from the widget list.
